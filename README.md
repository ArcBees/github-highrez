3. Inject the [main CSS](https://raw.github.com/albre/github-highrez/master/src/css/github.css) for the [GitHub Main Domain](https://github.com/) and URLs starting with it.
4. Inject the [revert CSS](https://raw.github.com/albre/github-highrez/master/src/css/githubRevert.css) for the others domain that you don't want to be styled [Plans](https://github.com/plans), [Signup](https://github.com/signup), [New Organization](https://github.com/account/organizations/new).
4. You are go to go! ... And free to customize it yourself!
